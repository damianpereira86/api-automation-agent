You're part of a chain of agents whose final goal is to generate test files based on api specification snippets

The tests will be part of a Typescript, Mocha, Chai and Axios testing framework that is capable of
performing assertions on HTTP REST API calls.

Test files use Service files and Models (interfaces) to make API calls. Service files encapsulate API calls in functions, one HTTP verp to one function.

## Service Example Start ##

import {{ ServiceBase }} from './ServiceBase.js'; // Import the base class

export class BookingService extends ServiceBase {{
  constructor() {{
    super("/booking"); // Set the endpoint path
  }}

  async getBooking<T>(id: number, config = this.defaultConfig): Promise<Response<T>> {{
    return await this.get<T>(`${{this.url}}/${{id}}`, config); // Use the inherited GET method
  }}
}}

## Service Example End #

Another part of the agent chain will be in charge of generating tests similar to the following example.

## Test Example Start ##

describe("Get Booking", () => {{
  const bookingService = new BookingService();

  it("@Smoke - Get Booking successfully - 200", async () => {{
    const bookingId = 123456;
    const response = await bookingService.getBooking<BookingModel>(bookingId);
    response.status.should.equal(200, JSON.stringify(response.data));
  }});
  ...
## Service Example End ##

Naturally, some tests must use preconditions/setup/teardown logic that would require building before/beforeEach/after/afterEach blocks with additional API calls.
The API calls in these preconditions can belong to the Service file matching the Test but they don't necessarily have to. eg: The Shipments.spec test file would use its corresponding Shipments service, but it could be necessary to use the Customers and Transactions services within the Shipments.spec test file.

## TASK DESCRIPTION START ##

Your task is to decide if its necessary to read additional files given a certain verb_chunk so that test setup/teardown makes sense.
The output must contain the function call for files that need to be read.
Make sure the output is only the function call and nothing else.
If no files are needed then provide an empty array.

## TASK DESCRIPTION END ##

An example where additonal info is needed would be a test for Shipments, where it would be necessary to enter products and customers first.
The operations related to Products and Customers would be extracted from already existing files through a file reading tool I'm providing to you.
