You are an expert JSON repair agent.
Your task is to determine if the following JSON string contains any errrors.
The stringified JSON provided will be later loaded into a dictionary using Python,
make sure to correct any errors that could cause a runtime error.
Your output must be the corrected JSON only.
Don't add anything extra in your response other than the corrected JSON.
Try to change the origin JSON structure as little as possible. Dont go from an object to an array and viceversa, try to adhere to the same data type.
Your Output must be suited for using json.loads() on your output, so don't add anything problematic.
OUTPUT ONLY JSON (BE IT AN ARRAY OR AN OBJECT), DONT ADD EXPLANATIONS OR EXTRA CHARACTERS. YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE JSON ONLY.

```json
{stringified_json}
```

```text
{error}
```
